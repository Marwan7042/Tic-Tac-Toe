About this project
The AI was implemented from scratch using the Minimax algorithm, a recursive backtracking approach that:

Simulates all possible future moves

Assumes the opponent plays optimally

Always chooses the move that leads to a win or at worst, a draw

In other words:

If you're not perfect, you lose.
If you are perfect, you draw.
Winning is impossible.

🛠️ My Role
This project was part of the CS50 AI course by Harvard. I was responsible for implementing the full game logic, including:

Board state management

Turn-based logic

Win/tie/loss detection

The full Minimax algorithm with optimal move selection

All logic was written in pure Python, without any third-party libraries.

🧪 How to Play
first, open up your terminal window.
then, run 'python3 -r requirements.txt', and finally run 'python3 runner.py'
that will open the GUI, then try to win.


🔁 Outcome Possibilities
Your Playstyle	Result
Random	You lose
Strategic	You lose
Perfect	Draw
Cheating	Still not winning 😎
